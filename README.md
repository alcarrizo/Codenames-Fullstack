# Codenames-Fullstack

Codenames Fullstack is a project I made because I enjoy playing codenames. And is inspired heavily by the official codenames website.

I originally made this without using a framework, however while I was researching what I would be using I stumbled upon fullstack open where I started learning the basics of react and bettered my understanding of servers.

So I upgraded my original codenames repository to using the React framework due to the ease of component resuability.
For the server I'm am using express along with socket.io
